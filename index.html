        <h3 style="color:purple;">I drove down Van Ness daily wondering what was being built here.What exactly was Bitwise I thought to myself. Thinking if there was any way I could one day find myself there. Fast forward to the day I found out they actually held classes here for web developemt. Immediately I was reminded of the Myspace days of when I would customize my profiles and how much I enjoyed doing that. Since I started taking classes here, I am learning new things each day I'm here. I'm excited to see where I'll be in a year.</h3>
